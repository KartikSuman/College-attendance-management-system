# College-attendance-management-system
This system can be used for Registering the details of Students ,and then take a daily digital attendance and at the end it can output the total number of present and absent students.
The data structure used here is a doubly linked list implemented with C language.
There are facilities for registering,as well as deletion of a record of a student.
There are many future scopes of this project, which can be implemented in the coming future.
